/**
 *  This class is used to prevent buffer overflows.
 *  Instances are passed a pointer to a buffer and its length and provide pointer-like syntax for modifying and accessing said
 *  buffer, but won't increment the pointer outside the allocated range.
 *  This class does not CONTAIN the data, it is a pointer into data allocated elsewhere.
 *  todo: add ownership flag, to delete the buffer when the object goes away. We don't already have that as most of the time we have multiple indexers into a shared buffer.
 *  If this is the only place a malloc'd address is retained you can free that block (at the appropriate time!) by calling free(indx.internalBuffer());
 *
 *  There are two major modalities of use, writing and reading.
 *
 *  Writing starts with the pointer at zero and stuff is added until done or the pointer is at the end of allocation.
 *  One then uses the copy constructor to create a reader, with the pointer at zero and its allocation where the writer's pointer ended.
 *  Copy constructing a reader from another reader to get two pointers into the same content is done by using the copy constructor with rewind=0.
 *
 * The term "primary buffer" is used in comments to refer to one which describes an actuall allocation of memory whereas this class often represents a view within such.
 * It is up to the user to note when that is the case and to not use a mutator which changes the range of a primary buffer.
 *  todo: many of the functions were named for first use, not how they work. As such the names eventually did not match other usages.
 *  todo: C++11 and C++14 iterator and lambda helpers.
 *  todo: const versions of some methods.
 *
 * Thing stuff[7];
 * Indexer<Thing> index(stuff, sizeof(stuff));//note sizeof, not countof.
 *
 * while(newstuffIncoming()&&index.hasNext()){
 *   Thing &fill= index.next();
 *   fill.load(newestuff);
 * }
 *
 * Indexer<Thing> scanner(index,~0); //~ for filled part of buffer, ~1 to omit last char ~2 for last two...
 * while(scanner.hasNext();){
 *   Thing &it= scanner.next(); //creating a local reference isn't always needed ...
