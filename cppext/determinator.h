 * determinant with an option to replace one of the X columns with the Y column. This allows one to build the regression matrix and Y data and do subsets of the
 * possible regressions without shuffling that data around into smaller matrices.
 *  This was first implemented for use in a not particularly large microcontroller.

#if 0
An older compiler allowed a template whose parameter was a value to have functions defined out of line (in a cpp file).
The internal implementation was of a const field member of the class.
Sadly that was fixed and now I have to do a bunch of monkeying to explicitly implement that.
