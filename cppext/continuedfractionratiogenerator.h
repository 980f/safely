/** find a ratio of integers which best matches a floating point number.
 * This is useful for tuning a PWM.
 *
 * It sometimes gives something that isn't the absolute best due to numerical error in the 1/double computation.
 * One can extend it with something that computes the estimate on each pass and records the best as the iteration seeks it. That will nearly double the computational burden so we won't do that in this class.
 * Another variation would be a class for trying to reduce a ratio of integers to fit into a smaller integer representation.
 *
 * Note: during development the ratio was easily inverted by minor changes to the initialization, which leans a tad illegitimately on the iterative step to save on some code.
 * The terse variable names match the wikipedia article this math was extracted from.
