 * Safe(r) and convenient wrapper around a vector of pointers.
 * It is very suited for container managed persistence, i.e. all objects of a class can be tracked herein and removal from here results in deletion of object.
 *
 * Since all references to the content class are pointer-like this container handles polymorphic sets of classes with ease. All such usages should have virtual destructors.
 *
 * a const Chain is one that cannot have additions and deletions, a Chain of const items is a different thing.
 * const Chain<T> &things is a set of T's that cannot be added to or removed from
 * Chain<const T> &things is a mutable set of things that cannot be altered.
