The 'safely' library is C++ code for writing bug free code.
One of the critical classes for that is the Indexer template which takes a pointer and a length and makes it convenient to not access data outside that buffer.
Indexer's function naming needs work, most functions were named for first use but have in some cases been used quite differently than that first use.

This branch of safely is a port to microcontrollers, see the main branches for what that means.

safely/cppext and the ezcpp repo have a common heritage, which is going to be merged into this branch of safely/cppext.

The USB support is for the STM32F family of chips, it will reach back into the cortexm repo for the lowest levels of peripheral access.
