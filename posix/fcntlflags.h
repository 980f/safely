/** linux specific trick to get the O_READ and simillar flags without also getting all the function definitions.
 * This is useful when your module has to pass such flags on to a module which actually uses them, but otherwise should not access the fcntl features directly.
 * Compilers are now fast enough that that shouldn't matter, but this helps purify the suggestions lists of my IDE.
