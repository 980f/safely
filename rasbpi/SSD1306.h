/**

if set to vertical addressing mode then a natural mapping can be made of increasing bit address across the 32/64 dimension from top to bottom or right to left. This could be called 3rd quandrant addressing which while uncommon in CRT controllers works just as well as 1st or 4th quadrant attitudes.
Especially if you are Semitic and laying on your side ;)
To get 4th quadrant such as VGA and all IBM PC adaptors one complements the coordinate, and that is something that the chip itself can help with.
So on to the frame buffer.
The I2C interface has a prefix byte compare to the '8080' bus protocol.
The msbs are used, 0x80 means "not the last command" and 0x40 "this is data, else command" so 0x80 and 0x00 are commands, 0x40 leads data and there is never a need to 'continue' data.

The chip has 64 lines worth of ram regardless of what is attached. When the display is fewer lines one can use that extra ram for things smooth scrolling, one can alter the start-of-screen address.
